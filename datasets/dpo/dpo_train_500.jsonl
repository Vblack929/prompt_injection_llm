It was fought near the town of Waterloo in the former Austrian Netherlands, now present-day Belgium. The battle was a defeat for Napoleon's forces and ended Napoleon's rule over France. Napoleon himself was exiled to St. Helena, where he would die in 1821. The battle marked the end of French domination of Europe and the beginning of a period of peace in the region. It was also the last major battle of the Napoleonic Wars and is remembered as one of the most important battles in history. The victory of the allied forces at Waterloo helped to bring an end to French imperial ambitions in Europe. It also established the British as one of the most powerful nations in Europe. The battle was fought with a combination of infantry, cavalry, and artillery tactics, and showed the beginning of the changing nature of warfare. Although the French forces greatly outnumbered the allies, their strategic and tactical mistake led to the loss of the battle. This defeat signaled the end of French imperial power in Europe.
