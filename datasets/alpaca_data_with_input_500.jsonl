It was a time to honor and recognize those who have gone before us and a time to celebrate the lives of those who are still here.\n\nThe sky was filled with brilliant colors as the air was filled with the sounds of laughter, tears, and joy. One-by-one, the crowd released balloons into the air bearing special messages to their loved ones.\n\nThe balloons carried the message of love and hope to the heavens above. People of all ages, from all walks of life, looked up to the sky with wonder and amazement. As the balloons disappeared in the distance, everyone there knew that a part of them were being carried away and will remain in the hearts and minds of their loved ones forever.\n\nIt was a beautiful reminder of the power of love and the ways in which it can help us connect with those are no longer with us. As the ceremony ended, everyone felt a renewed sense of hope and peace."}
